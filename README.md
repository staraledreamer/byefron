## Overview
ro.py is an asynchronous, object-oriented wrapper for the Roblox web API.

## Features
- **Asynchronous**: ro.py works well with asynchronous frameworks like [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and 
[discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py).  
- **Easy**: ro.py's client-based model is intuitive and easy to learn. 
  It abstracts away API requests and leaves you with simple objects that represent data on the Roblox platform.
- **Flexible**: ro.py's Requests object allows you to extend ro.py beyond what we've already implemented.

## Installation
To install the latest stable version of ro.py, run the following command:
```
python3 -m pip install byfron
```
